Design an embedded computer centered around the ATMega32 microcontroller. For input, use a keypad. For output, use an LCD. Write a C program that implements a digital clock, showing MM/DD/YYYY on the top row and HH:MM:SS on the bottom row. Provide all the UI needed to set the date/time on your digital clock.
